# blanim
A wrapper for manim for blockchain and blockDAG related animations

# About
BLanim (short for BLockDAG animations) is an extension of the [Manim (community)](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) Python package, a community-maintained version of the library used by 3Blue1Brown to animate mathematical concepts. BLanim extends Manim with utilities specifically designed for creating visual illustrations of blockchain and blockDAG related concepts. I develop Manim to produce animations for my YouTube channel, [the Deepdive](https://www.youtube.com/@desheDives).

BLanim is currently in a pre-pre-pre-alpha stage and is only publicly available for collaboration purposes. It is not well packaged yet, lacks documentation, and needs a lot of refactoring and missing features. If you'd like to contribute, please don't hesitate to contact me.
