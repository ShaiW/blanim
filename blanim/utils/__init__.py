# blanim/blanim/utils/__init__.py

"""Optional shared utilities for blanim.

This module contains utilities that may be shared across multiple blockchain
implementations. Most blockchain-specific utilities should be defined in their
respective utils/ subdirectories (e.g., blanim/blockDAGs/bitcoin/utils/).

Currently empty - utilities will be added as needed.
